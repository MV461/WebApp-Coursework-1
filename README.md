### Notes:
1. As I am using the Fetch API to retrieve data from lessons.json, simply opening index.html in a browser will not be work, as the Cross-Origin Request Policy will block it. [You can read here to get more information about it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp). A few solutions to deal with this:
    - Just use the Github Page Link from above.
    - Open it in VSCode, install the "Live Preview" extension, and after activating it, find and click the "Open in Browser" option. (This is what I used when developing.)
    - Disable the CORS policy on your browser. (I wasn't able to do this...)
